I'm a senior software engineer and musician. My dreams are to create art with computers and help quantum grow big. I'm currently working for [IonQ](https://ionq.com/) to integrate quantum frameworks with their quantum computers.

The [Posts](#Archive) page contains all my posts, and [About](#About) serves as a repository for miscellaneous information _(contact, interests, etc.)_. My [study guide](https://gist.github.com/splch/d32adc1ecd24cccb1b2f44039b337837) is available as well.

Have a look around and feel free to share! ðŸ¥³
